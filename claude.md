# SagaBorn D100 — d100srd.com

## Project Overview
A web application for the SagaBorn D100 tabletop RPG (a d100/BRP-derived system by Mike Bielaczyc and Dane Clark Collins): full SRD, bestiary, character builder, quick character generator, dice roller, and character management. Think D&D Beyond, for SagaBorn.

**Repository**: https://github.com/daneclarkcollins/d100srd-next.git
**Tech stack**: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, MDX (next-mdx-remote + remark-gfm), Supabase (Postgres + Auth)
**Deployment**: Vercel, automatic from `main`. No feature branches — commit to main, keep the build green (`npm run build` before pushing).
**Legacy**: the old WordPress site's Docker config lives in the separate `d100srd-dev` repo — obsolete, kept for reference only.

## Canonical Rules Pipeline (the important part)

The rules live in **Google Drive**: `Shared With Me > SagaBorn > SagaBorn RPG > D100 SagaBorn` — numbered docs `000`–`010`, plus `*012 Character Gallery and Creature Compendium` and ~80 monster docs in the `BRP Monsters` subfolder.

Rules of the pipeline:

1. **Doc 000 (Errata) is canonical.** When chapter text and errata disagree, the errata wins. Mike posts rulings there; chapter-text cleanup trails behind.
2. **Everything mechanical is encoded in `lib/game-data/`** — typed TypeScript data + formula modules. The app computes from this layer, never from prose.
3. **`npm run validate:data`** checks referential integrity (profession skill grants resolve, talent prerequisite graphs close, lifepath tables tile their die ranges, weapon→skill joins, dice expressions parse). Run it after any data change.
4. **`npx tsx scripts/test-generator.ts`** stress-tests the character generator (1000 seeds + every species × archetype + every profession, invariants + reproducibility).
5. When Mike edits docs: re-pull the affected doc from Drive, re-encode the affected `lib/game-data/*.ts` file, re-run both scripts.
6. Known open doc issues are tracked as `// data note:` comments in the data files and in the "remaining fixes by chapter" doc shared with Mike (July 2026).

## Core Formulas (errata-backed, in lib/game-data/rules.ts)
- HP = CON + SIZ (unconscious at 0; dead at −10 at start of next round)
- SP = ACU; base mana = ⌊ACU/2⌋ (granted by any mana talent), cap = INT×5
- Characteristic roll = value × 5; Will=ACU, Reflex=DEX, Fortitude/Stamina=CON
- Crit = round(skill/20), Special = round(skill/5) — round-half-up matches the printed chart; fumble = 100 only; 01–05 auto-success floor
- Creation: stats 7–19 (SG beyond), 250 professional + INT×10 personal skill points, 75% creation cap (languages exempt at 90%), 3 talent points, skill category bonus = ⌈linked char/2⌉ (mandatory)
- Advancement: +2 per experience roll, 90 cap without a Talent; characteristic training = value×25 hours
- Turn = 10 min = 60 rounds (10 s each); MOV by SIZ (Medium 25')

## MDX Content Conventions
- Frontmatter: `title`, `order` (chapter sort), `category` (`chapter` | `spell` | `creature`), `description`.
- **Pipe tables only** (remark-gfm is wired into every MDXRemote renderer — never raw HTML tables).
- Escape literal `*` footnote markers as `&#42;`, and `<` `>` `{` `}` as entities. MDX treats `{}` as JSX.
- Chapter slugs are stable for SEO (`3-professions`, `1-talents`, `a-spot-rules`, ...). The SRD index in `app/rules/RulesPageClient.tsx` is a hardcoded list — update it when adding chapters.

## Environment
`.env.local`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (project `uuayqmspuiyolwayuhxz`). `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` only if admin features need it.

## Roadmap to 1.0
- [x] SRD re-imported from canonical docs (2026-07-15), spells + bestiary complete
- [x] Game-data layer + validator + quick generator
- [x] Production build green; legacy formula bugs fixed (HP, SP, MOV, XP bonus, damage mod)
- [x] Character builder migrated onto `lib/game-data` (lib/character-data.ts is a pure adapter)
- [x] Encounter Builder on Compendium CV tiers (109 structured creature stat blocks in lib/game-data/creatures.ts)
- [x] Equipment data complete: shields, ammunition, mounts, vehicles, siege weapons
- [x] content/tools WordPress exports retired (superseded by real tools)
- [x] Live HP/SP tracking (CharacterQuickStats) + print/PDF export on the character sheet
- [ ] Shareable character links — needs a Supabase schema addition (share token + RLS policy); requires dashboard access
- [ ] End-to-end auth flow verification against live Supabase (needs a real signup)
- [ ] Admin content editing (or accept the Drive→re-import pipeline as the workflow — recommend the latter)
